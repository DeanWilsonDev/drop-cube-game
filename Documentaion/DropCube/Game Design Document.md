**Camera Movement**: The camera moves downwards with the player but not at the same rate as the player. It will slow down when the player is at the top of the screen to give them a chance to catch up, and speed up when the player is at the bottom of the screen in order to catch up to the player. The Camera will also speed up over time.

**Death**: If the Player can't keep up with the movement of the Camera, the player will lose

**Points**: The player will be awarded Points for each new room that they enter.
